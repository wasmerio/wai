[features]
# Enables generated code to emit events via the `tracing` crate whenever wasm is
# entered and when native functions are called. Note that tracing is currently
# only done for imported functions.
tracing = ['tracing-lib', 'wasmer-wit-bindgen-wasmtime-impl/tracing']

# Enables async support for generated code, although when enabled this still
# needs to be configured through the macro invocation.
